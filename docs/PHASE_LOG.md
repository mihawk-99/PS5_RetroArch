# Phase log

Append-only. A dated entry per landed step, newest at the end. Never rewrite an
existing entry: a correction is a new entry that says what it corrects. This
file is read by search and by its tail, never end to end.

An entry holds, in this order: what changed, why it is right, the evidence (the
exact command or run and what it returned), and the commit. Keep the failures in
too — the runs that were wrong are what stop the next agent from repeating them.

## 2026-09-18: The documentation contract is instantiated for PS5 RetroArch

The repository stopped being a template. `AGENTS.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`,
`docs/ACTIVE.md`, `docs/REFERENCE.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`,
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/FINDINGS.md` and
`tools/verify.sh` now describe a PS5 RetroArch port: its gates, its milestone
map (M0 contract, M1 console shell, M2 video and input, M3 cores and storage,
M4 audio, mapping and release), its four invariants, its step ladder, the
pinned environment, and the evidence rules. It exists because the project has
to be defined before any code is written, and it unblocks every later step.

**The evidence.** `grep -rno '{{[A-Z0-9_]*}}' AGENTS.md docs tools .gitignore`
returns nothing, so no template placeholder is left in the read path;
`bash -n tools/verify.sh` and `tools/verify.sh --list` return the five gate
commands; the toolchain was proven to work by cross-compiling a hello-world C
file, which produced an ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1
(FreeBSD), 110,712 bytes, from `prospero-clang` 22.1.8 targeting
`x86_64-sie-ps5`. The four findings of the survey are committed in
`docs/FINDINGS.md`; the environment facts are in `docs/REFERENCE.md`.

**What was tried first.** The first draft of the plan assumed the shipped
graphics path was a Vulkan context driver through `../PS5_Vulkan` and treated
the OpenGL project as unrelated. Reading the two local checkouts showed the
opposite ordering: the OpenGL project is the only one with an installed consumer
package, a pkg-config contract and a recorded hardware acceptance run, while the
Vulkan project has driver sources and headers but no consumer package yet.
`docs/REFERENCE.md` now records both stages with the M2.1 measurement that
decides between them, instead of the assumption. Recorded here so the next step
does not rediscover it.

**Commit.** `3dfc3dd` — Instantiate the agent documentation contract for PS5
RetroArch.
